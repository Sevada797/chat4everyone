# chat4everyone
This is a chat accessible from terminal or command prompt,
it is built using bash and curl, and for windows I made the same with batch.

Use following commands to enter my chat server if you are on linux.

<b style="color: #24292f">git clone https://github.com/Sevada797/chat4everyone<br>
cd chat4everyone<br>
chmod +x chat.sh<br>
./chat.sh</b>

or without changing permissions just  
<b style="color: #24292f">bash chat.sh</b>

If you are on windows just copy chat.bat code in notepad and save it as (smth).bat.
