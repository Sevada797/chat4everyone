# chat4everyone
This is a chat accessible from terminal or command prompt,
it is built using bash and curl, and for windows I'm gonna make the same
with batch

Use following commands to enter my chat server

<b>git clone https://github.com/Sevada797/chat4everyone<br>
cd chat4everyone<br>
chmod +x chat.sh<br>
./chat.sh</b>

or without changing permissions just  
<b>bash chat.sh</b>
